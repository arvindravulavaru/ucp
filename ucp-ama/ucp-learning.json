          "question": "What problem does UCP solve?",
          "answer": "**The Current Reality:**\nToday's commerce landscape is fragmented. Every platform that wants to enable commerce (AI agents, apps, social media) needs to build custom integrations with each business. A platform supporting 100 businesses needs 100 different integrations. This doesn't scale.\n\n**The UCP Solution:**\nUCP provides a standardized common language - like HTTP for commerce. Instead of building custom integrations, everyone speaks the same protocol.\n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- **For Platforms:** One integration works with all UCP-compliant businesses\n- **For Businesses:** Expose commerce capabilities once, be discovered by any platform\n- **For Users:** Seamless commerce across any surface (chat, voice, visual)\n- **For Payment Providers:** Standardized, secure payment flows\n\n**Real-World Analogy:**\nThink of electrical outlets. Before standardization, every appliance needed its own custom socket. UCP is that standardization for commerce - one \"socket\" that works everywhere.",

          "answer": "UCP defines four distinct roles in any commerce transaction:\n\n**1. Platform (Application/Agent)**\n- **Role:** Consumer-facing surface acting on behalf of users\n- **Examples:** AI Shopping Assistants, Super Apps, Search Engines, Social Commerce\n\n**2. Business (Merchant)**\n- **Role:** Seller of goods/services, always the Merchant of Record (MoR)\n- **Key Point:** Business retains financial liability and customer relationship\n\n**3. Credential Provider (CP)**\n- **Role:** Manages sensitive user data securely\n- **Responsibility:** Issues payment tokens - raw card data never touches Platform/Business\n- **Examples:** Digital Wallets (Google Wallet, Apple Pay)\n\n**4. Payment Service Provider (PSP)**\n- **Role:** Financial infrastructure provider\n- **Examples:** Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Braintree\n\n**Why This Separation Matters:**\n1. **Security:** Raw payment data never touches Platform or Business\n2. **Compliance:** Reduces PCI scope for Platform and Business\n3. **Flexibility:** Mix and match any Platform + Business + PSP/CP\n4. **Separation of Concerns:** Each actor focuses on their expertise",

          "answer": "**Common Question:** \"We already have Payment Request API, Apple Pay, Google Pay. Why UCP?\"\n\n**The Key Difference:**\n- **Payment Request API / Apple Pay / Google Pay:** Focus on payment instrument collection and tokenization (the CP role in UCP)\n- **UCP:** Provides the full commerce lifecycle\n\n**What UCP Covers:**\n1. Product discovery\n2. Cart management\n3. Tax calculation\n4. Checkout orchestration\n5. Order management\n6. Post-purchase support (returns, tracking)\n7. Webhooks for real-time updates\n\n**Complementary, Not Competitive:**\nUCP actually *uses* existing payment standards. Example flow:\n1. Platform initiates UCP checkout\n2. Business calculates tax/shipping via UCP\n3. Payment collected via Google Pay (which issues a token)\n4. Business's PSP exchanges token with Google to process payment\n5. Order updates flow through UCP webhooks\n\n**Key Insight:** UCP is higher-level - it's about the entire commerce interaction, not just payments.",

Platform says \"I support versions X, Y, Z\"\n2. Business says \"I support versions Y, Z, W\"\n3. Business selects Y or Z (usually latest both support)\n4. Business uses that version for the session\n\n**Benefits of Server-Selects:**\n- Business controls rollout\n- Easier A/B testing\n- Simpler platform code (no fallback chains)\n- Gradual evolution without breaking changes\n\n**Profiles are cached** by both parties, allowing efficient capability negotiation within normal request/response flow.",
